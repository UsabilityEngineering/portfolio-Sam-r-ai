# Journal One: User Experience: The Pioneer DJ DDJ-FLX4 Controller

**Justin Cheung – 9/3/2025**

Hello everyone, today I will be sharing my user experience with the Pioneer DJ board. I love listening to remixes and have always wanted to learn how to mix myself. My end goal is to get good enough to DJ at a party at least once.

Here is a photo of what the board looks like.

The board from Pioneer comes with free software called Rekordbox, which I had to download onto my laptop and other computers I want to mix on. The board is plugged in via USB-C. I didn’t have to play around with where the audio comes from because it automatically plays out of my computer, but if I want to play it out of speakers, I need to plug in additional cables that I don’t have. I navigated the controls by having a friend teach me a little bit and then just messing around with the board.

The goal of having a DJ board is to mix songs live or recorded. Having a DJ board allows me to create mashups of my favorite songs and also change them up by adding new sounds like extra snaps, claps, fades, etc. The **affordance** of this board looks pretty confusing if someone has never seen a DJ board before. This one is pretty simple, though, and most people who DJ that I know of have this board.

The board is symmetrical. Knowing that this board is used to mix songs, I would think that one song would be controlled by the left side and the other by the right side. There's a play/pause button on both sides. Seeing that, I would think it is used to play/pause a song. There's a cue button. I wouldn’t know what it did until I played with it and found out how to mark songs and cue them up to the marked spot so that when I pressed play, it would play the part I wanted.

The two large turntables resemble CDs. If I were to rewind a CD, I’d make it go back. The turntables are used to rewind and fast-forward to parts of songs, which makes sense when I look at them. Then there are all these other labeled buttons like hot cue, padfx, beat jump, and sampler that I don’t know what they do unless I play with them. Without having prior DJ knowledge, I just had to use intuition to guess. Tempo looks pretty easy to change up the speed of the songs.

Here is a live demo of using the board to mix songs.

The **convention** of this product is familiar compared to a lot of other DJ products. The turntables, knobs, and buttons are universally understandable to someone who mixes. I can boot up songs I’ve saved onto streaming platforms like SoundCloud, and navigating those songs using the UI is pretty simple.

There is good **feedback** because lights blink when I press a button, letting me know that the feature is on. When I rewind songs, I hear that feedback immediately as well. When I turn knobs, I hear the music fade in and out.

My **mental model** worked pretty well. I play music and have used a lot of audio software, so most of the labeled buttons made intuitive sense to me in terms of what they do.

The board is pretty smooth and intuitive. I think there’s just a learning curve, and I have a lot more learning to do, but it’s super easy to switch between songs. I’m excited to learn more of its features because there are a ton. I’ve just been doing the basic stuff.

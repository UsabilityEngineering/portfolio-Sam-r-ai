# Justin Cheung's UX Portfolio

![A photo of Justin](./IMG_4414.jpg)

Hello, my name is Justin. I am a computer science major with a marketing minor. I plan on doing sales for my career. I joined computer science because I always wanted to learn how to create things digitally. 
User Design is related to my career because everything I do will have some user using my product. Making a product simple to use is going to be a big selling point.
